title: Do model names need to be unique?
---
Yes! To build dependencies between models, you need to use the `ref` function.
The `ref` function only takes one argument â€” the model name (i.e. the filename).
As a result, these model names need to be unique, even if they are in separate
folders.

Often, this question comes up because users want to name two models `customers`
in their warehouse, splitting them across separate schemas. Checkout the docs on
[custom aliases](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/using-custom-aliases) and [custom
schemas](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/using-custom-schemas) to achieve this.
