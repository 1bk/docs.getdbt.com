This tutorial is geared at first-time users who want detailed instructions on
how to go from zero to a deployed dbt project.

This tutorial is based on a fictional business named `jaffle_shop`, so you'll
see this name used throughout the project.

In this tutorial, we will be turning the following query into a dbt project that
is tested, documented, and deployed.
```sql
with customers as (

    select
        id as customer_id,
        first_name,
        last_name

    from `dbt-tutorial`.jaffle_shop.customers

),

orders as (

    select
        id as order_id,
        user_id as customer_id,
        order_date,
        status

    from `dbt-tutorial`.jaffle_shop.orders

),

customer_orders as (

    select
        customer_id,

        min(order_date) as first_order_date,
        max(order_date) as most_recent_order_date,
        count(order_id) as number_of_orders

    from orders

    group by 1

),


final as (

    select
        customers.customer_id,
        customers.first_name,
        customers.last_name,
        customer_orders.first_order_date,
        customer_orders.most_recent_order_date,
        coalesce(customer_orders.number_of_orders, 0) as number_of_orders

    from customers

    left join customer_orders using (customer_id)

)

select * from final
```

## Create a BigQuery project
We will be using BigQuery as our data warehouse in this tutorial since there is
a free tier. We've created a public dataset (`dbt-tutorial`) that anyone with
a BigQuery account can query.

You'll need your own BigQuery project for your dbt project.

<LoomVideo id="9b8d852c7e754d978209c3a60b53464e" />

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery -- if you don't have a
BigQuery account you will be asked to create one.
2. Create a new project -- you can use the default name for the project.
<Lightbox src="/img/create-bigquery-project.png"
          title="Create a BigQuery project"></Lightbox>
3. Copy and paste the above query into the BigQuery console to validate that you
can run it.

## Generate BigQuery credentials
In order to let dbt connect to your warehouse, you'll need generate a keyfile.
This is analogous to using a database user name and password with most other
data warehouses.

<LoomVideo id="2b5a8ec255bd4dce91374f6941d279e5" />

1. Go to the [BigQuery credential wizard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/wizard). Ensure that your new project is selected at the top of the screen.
2. Generate credentials with the following options:
    * Which API are you using? BigQuery API
    * Are you planning to use this API with App Enginer or Compute Engine? No, I'm not using them
    * Service account name: `dbt-user`
    * Key type: JSON
3. Download the JSON file and save it in a place you can access


## Choose the way you want to develop
Thereâ€™s two main ways of working with dbt:
1. Edit files and run projects using the web-based Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) in **dbt Cloud**.
2. Edit files locally using a code editor, and run projects using the Command
Line Interface (**dbt CLI**).

To use the CLI, it's important that you know some basics of your terminal. In
particular, you should understand `cd`, `ls` and `pwd` to navigate through the
directory structure of your computer easily. As such, if you are new to
programming, we recommend using **dbt Cloud** for this tutorial.

If you wish to use the CLI, please follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/installation)
for your operating system.
