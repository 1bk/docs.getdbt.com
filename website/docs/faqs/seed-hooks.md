title: Do hooks run with seeds?
---

Yes! The following hooks are available:
- [pre-hooks](reference/resource-configs/pre-hook.md)
- [post-hooks](reference/resource-configs/post-hook.md)
- [on-run-start](reference/project-configs/on-run-start.md)
- [on-run-end](reference/project-configs/on-run-end.md)

Configure these in your `dbt_project.yml` file.
