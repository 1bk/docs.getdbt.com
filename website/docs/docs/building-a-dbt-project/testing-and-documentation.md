## Overview

dbt makes it easy to build and modify data models. With this flexibility comes a question: how do you ensure that you don't accidentally break existing models, and how do you keep your colleagues apprised of your changes?

This section of the docs explores _testing_ and _documenting_ your models. With testing, you can validate that your models are working correctly. With documentation, you can describe your models in rich detail.

By leveraging testing and documentation, you can automatically generate documentation for your dbt project that looks something like this:
