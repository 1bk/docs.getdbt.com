:::info Enterprise Feature

This guide describes a feature of the dbt Cloud Enterprise plan. 
If youâ€™re interested in learning more about an Enterprise plan, contact us at sales@getdbt.com.

## Overview

With enterprise security features, you can manage secure access to your dbt Cloud account and access dbt Cloud objects within the account. We recommend setting up [SSO](/docs/dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-enterprise/sso-overview) and dbt Cloud groups to easily manage user access.

## RBAC groups

When you create dbt Cloud groups, you can associate Identity Provider (IdP) group(s) to the group.
This will allow users who log in via the SSO flow to be automatically associated with the corresponding dbt Cloud group. While multiple IdP groups may be associated with one dbt Cloud group, we recommend having a 1:1 mapping for simplicity. Having the same name for your IdP group as for your dbt Cloud group will make adminstration easier. 

To reset a user's group membership, have the user relog into dbt Cloud. This will be needed when a 
user is added to a new dbt Cloud group via a new IdP group.

## Permission Sets

The following permission sets are available for assignment in dbt Cloud Enterprise accounts. They 
can be granted to dbt Cloud groups which are then in turn granted to users. A dbt Cloud group 
can be associated with more than one permission sets.
