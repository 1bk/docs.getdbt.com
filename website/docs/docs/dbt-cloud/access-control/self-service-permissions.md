## Overview

dbt Cloud supports two different permission sets to manage permissions for self-service accounts: **Member** and **Owner**. The permissions afforded to each role are described below. **Note:** users configured with "read only" license types will experience a restricted set of permissions in dbt Cloud. See [Seats and Users](cloud-seats-and-users) for more information on the impact of licenses on these permissions.
