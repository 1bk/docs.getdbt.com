dbt Cloud supports the three latest minor releases of dbt Core. At the present time, the following versions of dbt are supported:
 - v0.16.x
 - v0.15.x
 - v0.14.x

While you can currently schedule dbt jobs to run on versions of dbt released prior to 0.14.x, these versions may become unavailable in a future release. Because dbt Cloud leverages functionality built into dbt Core, some functionality in the dbt Cloud application may be unavailable to users running outdated or unsupported versions of dbt Core.
