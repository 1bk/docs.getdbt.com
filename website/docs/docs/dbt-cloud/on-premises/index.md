_This section is intended for system administrators of installations of dbt Cloud into Enterprise customers' cloud providers. For access to dbt Cloud's on premises offering, [please contact our sales team](mailto:sales@getdbt.com)._

dbt Cloud is bundled a Kubernetes appliance that can be automatically installed into a standalone Kubernetes cluster.

dbt Cloud uses a collection of open source technologies called Kubernetes-off-the-shelf ([KOTS](https://kots.io/)) to manage installations. Internally, dbt Cloud is a Kubernetes appliance, but you do not need to already use Kubernetes to run it. It supports two different deployment models: installation into an existing Kubernetes cluster, or installation onto a bare Linux instance or VM.
