##  Overview

This is intended for system administrators of dbt Cloud to increase the number of accounts 
supported on their dbt cloud instance. If this is something you are interested in, please contact your
Account Manager or support (support@getdbt.com). 

### Setup SSO

For every dbt cloud account with SSO configuration, a new application should be created on the SSO provider. This will assure users of the same IdP organization will be mapped to appropriate dbt Cloud accounts via SSO login. 

#### Please follow the appropriate integration-specific guide for your setup:
[Azure Active Directory](dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-enterprise/setting-up-enterprise-sso-with-azure-active-directory.md)
[GSuite](dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-enterprise/setting-up-sso-with-google-gsuite.md)
[Okta](dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-enterprise/setting-up-sso-with-okta.md)

#### Key Tips: 
Rather than naming the application name as `Dbt Cloud`, associate it with the Account so it would be `Dbt Cloud Account_Name` to be specific with what application is associated with which dbt cloud account 
You will still need to send over the requested information at the bottom of the guides to your Account Manager. 
SSO User Creation Guide

### Create a dbt Cloud Account
To create a new account, navigate to the dbt Cloud backend at https://<hostname>/backend. You can login as the "superuser" to perform the steps below.

After logging in, you can create a new account and invite members of your team, by doing the following:
1. Under Database > Accounts, click + Add. 
2. Enter a name for the account
3. Under Concurrency, click Show. Enter how many concurrent jobs to allow for this account. If you aren't sure, pick 1 for now.
4. Add users to the account (this is important -- if you don't add users, nobody will be able to access the account!)
5. Setting up the Login 
    a. For SSO, fill out this section of the enterprise options with your unique identifier and login slug for the specific SSO application created above.

```
1.For Azure AD and GSuite, the unique identifier is the deployment id provided when creating the app.
2. For Okta, the unique identifier is the "Identity Provider Issuer"
3. The "login slug" is added to the Enterprise Login URL to create a unique login link for users of this account.
4. If you aren't sure which values to use, contact your Account Manager.
```
    b. If using username / email login, you can invite users to this account by email from this page. Under Invites, enter the email address(es) of users you'd like to invite. When you save the account, 
    these users will receive an invitation in their inbox.
    
 6. Save the new account.

### Onboarding users
Here are the steps to onboard users to the new account. 

1. Create the Projects
    a. The dbt cloud administrator will need to create the projects either themselves or invite an AccountAdmin level user to the account to establish the projects necessary for the required environments. 
        i. Remember that it is one data warehouse connection and one git repository per project.
        ii. This needs to be created on the frontend of dbt Cloud.
2. Establish the connections to the data warehouse and git repository.
    a. This needs to be created on the frontend  of dbt Cloud. 
3. Create the Groups
    a. If you want to utilize [Enterprise Permissions](dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-enterprise/enterprise-permissions.md), create the groups with the appropriate SSO mappings so that new users will be associated to the appropriate groups once logged in. 
    b. Associate the groups to the appropriate projects.
    c. This needs to be created on the backend of dbt Cloud
4. Test the IDE (Develop) to assure that the connections are working correctly. 
    a. Follow the steps provided with the setup guide. 
    b. This needs to be performed on the frontend of dbt Cloud.
5. Provide access to dbt Cloud via the Enterprise Login URL to users
    a. You can find this url in the Account information on the backend under the section Enterprise Options. 


### Management of dbt Cloud

Here is how the backend and front end management of dbt Cloud will look like:

#### Backend
Creation and Maintenance of:

```
- Accounts 
- Groups
- SSO configuration 
```

#### Frontend
Creation and Maintenance of:

```
- Projects 
- Group Membership
- Project level specifics 

```

```
The total number of seats (developer and read-only) utilized in all of your accounts should never exceed the total number of seats associated with your license. Contact your account manager if additional seats are needed. 
The way to track the number of users on an account is via Accounts > Account Name > User Licenses
There is no console to provide an overview of seats in all accounts.
```
