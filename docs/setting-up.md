title: Setting up
---
This tutorial is geared at first-time users who want detailed instructions on how to go from zero to a dbt Project that follows some of our best practices.

In this tutorial, we will be turning the following query into a model built in dbt.
```sql
with customers as (

    select
        id as customer_id,
        first_name,
        last_name,
        email

    from `dbt-tutorial`.jaffle_shop.customers

),

orders as (

    select
        id as order_id,
        user_id as customer_id,
        order_date,
        status

    from `dbt-tutorial`.jaffle_shop.orders

),

customer_orders as (

    select
        customer_id,

        min(order_date) as first_order,
        max(order_date) as most_recent_order,
        count(order_id) as number_of_orders
    from orders

    group by 1

),


final as (

    select
        customers.customer_id,
        customer_orders.first_order,
        customer_orders.most_recent_order,
        customer_orders.number_of_orders,

    from customers

    left join customer_orders using (customer_id)

)

select * from final
```

## Create a new BigQuery project
We will be using BigQuery as our data warehouse in this tutorial since there is
a free tier. We've created a public dataset (`dbt-tutorial`) that anyone with
a BigQuery account can query.

You'll need your own BigQuery project for your dbt project.
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery -- if you do not have a
BigQuery account you will be asked to create one.
2. Create a new project -- use the default name for the project.
<img alt="Create a BigQuery project" src="/img/create-bigquery-project.png" class="docImage"/>
3. Copy and paste the above query into the BigQuery console to validate that you
can run it.

## Create a GitHub repository
1. Go to https://github.com/ and sign up for an account if you don't already have one.
1. Click on the green **New** button or go to https://github.com/new.
1. Type a repository name without spaces. For example, `dbt-tutorial`.
1. Click **Create repository** (without `.gitignore` and without a license).

## Choose the way you want to develop
[reframe as develpoing locally / in the cloud?]
If you are new to programming, we recommend using **dbt Cloud**.


You may prefer to use the command line interface (**dbt CLI**) to work on your project.
Please follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/installation)
for your operating system.
If you choseto use the CLI, we recommend learning some basics of your terminal
to help you work more effectively. In particular, it's important to understand
`cd`, `ls` and `pwd` to be able to navigate through the directory structure of
your computer easily.

## Create a project
### dbt Cloud
* [gotta do the onboarding flow with Kyle]

### dbt CLI
The dbt CLI comes with a command to help you scaffold a dbt project.To create
your dbt project:
1. Run the `init` command:
```bash
## to-do: should we have a `cd`command here first?
dbt init dbt-tutorial
```
2. `cd` into your project:
```bash
cd dbt-tutorial
```
You can use `pwd` to confirm that you are in the right spot.

3. Open your project (i.e. the directory you just created) in a code editor like
Atom or VSCode. You should see a directory structure with `.sql` and `.yml` files
that were generated by the `init` command.

4. Link your GitHub repository to your dbt project by running the following
commands:
```bash
git init
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/dbt-tutorial.git
git push -u origin master
```

> :information_source: If this is your first time using git, it's worth taking
some time to understand the basics.

## Connect to BigQuery
### dbt Cloud
This should be part of the onboarding flow :)

### dbt CLI
When developing locally, dbt connects to your data warehouse using a `profile`.
1. Create a file in the `~/.dbt/` directory named `profiles.yml`:
2. Copy the following into the file:
```yaml
dbt_tutorial:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: bigquery
      method: oauth
      project: graceful-creek-264520 # Replace this with your project id
      dataset: dbt_alice # Replace this with dbt_your_name, e.g. dbt_bob
      threads: 1
      timeout_seconds: 300
      location: US # Optional, one of US or EU
      priority: interactive
```
3. Update the `profile:` config in your your `dbt_project.yml` file as follows:
```yaml
profile: 'dbt_tutorial'
```
4. Authenticate your Google Account by running the following:
```bash
gcloud auth login
```
5. Run the debug command from your project to confirm that you can succesfully
connect
```bash
dbt debug
```
Confirm that the last line of the output is `Connection test: OK connection ok`.
