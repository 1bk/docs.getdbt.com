title: Test and document your project

## Add tests
1. Create a new YAML file in the `models` directory, named `models/schema.yml`
2. Add the following contents to the file:
```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: stg_customers
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null

  - name: stg_orders
    columns:
      - name: order_id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      - name: status
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: ['placed', 'shipped', 'completed', 'return_pending', 'returned']

  - name: customers
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null


```
3. Execute `dbt test`, and confirm that all your tests passed.
[ to-do: passing image ]

## Extra exercises
* Try writing a test that fails, for example, omit one of the `payment_types`
in the `accepted_values` list. What does a failing test look like? Can you debug
the failure?
* Try running the tests for one model only. If you grouped your `stg_` models
into a directory, try running the tests for all the models in that directory.

## Add documentation
1. Update your `models/schema.yml` file to include some descriptions:
```yaml
[ to-do ]
```
2. Execute `dbt docs generate` to generate the documentation for your project.
3. Execute `dbt docs serve` to launch the documentation in a local website.

ðŸŽ‰Congrats! You've just built your first dbt project!
