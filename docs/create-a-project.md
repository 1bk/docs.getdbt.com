title: Create a project
---

The process of creating a project is where the workflow differs the most between
dbt Cloud and dbt CLI workflows.

## dbt Cloud
### Create a project
1. Create a dbt Cloud account [here](https://cloud.getdbt.com/signup/). If your
organization already has a dbt Cloud account, ask an admin to add you as a
Developer.
2. If you created a new account, a new project should automatically be created.
If you were added to an existing account:
  * Click the hamburger menu, then `Account Settings`, then `Projects`.
  * Name your project "dbt Tutorial", and click `Save`. There's no need to fill
  in the other details.
  * Click the hamburger menu, and then `Home`.
  * Switch the project in the header bar to your new "dbt Tutorial" project.
3. Complete the onboarding flow:
  * Connect to BQ
  * Add a repository -- choose managed repository (if you're comfortable with git,
  you can also choose to link to an existing, but bare, repository)
4. Open Develop tab -- Select `Initialize a project`.

### Perform your first dbt run
5. Confirm that you can `dbt run`

### Commit your changes
1. Make your first commit

## dbt CLI
### Create a repo
1. Go to https://github.com/ and sign up for an account if you don't already have one.
2. Click on the green **New** button or go to https://github.com/new.
3. Type a repository name without spaces. For example, `dbt-tutorial`.
4. Click **Create repository** (without `.gitignore` and without a license).

### Create a project
The dbt CLI comes with a command to help you scaffold a dbt project. To create
your dbt project:
1. Run the `init` command:
```bash
dbt init jaffle-shop
```
2. `cd` into your project:
```bash
cd jaffle-shop
```
You can use `pwd` to confirm that you are in the right spot.

3. Open your project (i.e. the directory you just created) in a code editor like
Atom or VSCode. You should see a directory structure with `.sql` and `.yml` files
that were generated by the `init` command.

4. Update the following values in the `dbt_project.yml` file:
```yaml
name: jaffle_shop # this normally says my_new_package

...

profile: jaffle_shop # this normally says default

...

models:
  jaffle_shop: #this normally says my_new_package. It should match the value for `name:`
    ...
```




### Connect to BigQuery
When developing locally, dbt connects to your data warehouse using a `profile`.
1. Create a file in the `~/.dbt/` directory named `profiles.yml`.
2. Move your BigQuery keyfile into this directory.
3. Copy the following into the file, updating where indicated.
```yaml
jaffle_shop:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: bigquery
      method: service-account
      keyfile: /Users/claire/.dbt/graceful-creek-cred.json # replace this with the full path to your keyfile
      project: graceful-creek-264520 # Replace this with your project id
      dataset: dbt_alice # Replace this with dbt_your_name, e.g. dbt_bob
      threads: 1
      timeout_seconds: 300
      location: US
      priority: interactive
```

4. Execute the debug command from your project to confirm that you can successfully
connect
```bash
dbt debug
```
Confirm that the last line of the output is `Connection test: OK connection ok`.

### Perform your first dbt run
5. Execute the run command to build your first (example) model:
```bash
dbt run
```
You should have an ouput that looks like this:
```
Running with dbt=0.15.0
Found 1 model, 0 tests, 0 snapshots, 0 analyses, 133 macros, 0 operations, 0 seed files, 0 sources

13:15:29 |
13:15:29 | Finished running 1 view model in 2.87s.

Done. PASS=1 WARN=0 ERROR=0 SKIP=0 TOTAL=1
```


## Commit your changes

5. Link your GitHub repository to your dbt project by running the following
commands:
```bash
git init
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/dbt-tutorial.git
git push -u origin master
```

> ℹ️ If this is your first time using git, it's worth taking some time to
understand the basics.
