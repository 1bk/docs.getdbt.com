Now that we've successfully run our sample query, and chosen the way we want to
develop, we can create a dbt project! In this step, we'll create a starter project
with example models, before we build our first models.

> ℹ️ These are the instructions for developing a project using the dbt CLI. If
you're developing in dbt Cloud, follow the instructions [here](docs/create-a-project-dbt-cloud).

## Create a repository

1. Go to https://github.com/ and sign up for an account if you don't already have one.
2. Click on the green **New** button or go to https://github.com/new.
3. Type a repository name without spaces. For example, `dbt-tutorial`.
4. Click **Create repository** (without `.gitignore` and without a license).

            width="300px"
            alt="Create a GitHub repo"

## Create a project
<iframe width="640" height="400" src="https://www.loom.com/embed/f36152340ccc41e8be517eb295c4d6f1" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

The dbt CLI comes with a command to help you scaffold a dbt project. To create
your dbt project:
1. Run the `init` command:
```shell-session
$ dbt init jaffle-shop
```
2. `cd` into your project:
```shell-session
$ cd jaffle-shop
```
You can use `pwd` to confirm that you are in the right spot.

3. Open your project (i.e. the directory you just created) in a code editor like
Atom or VSCode. You should see a directory structure with `.sql` and `.yml` files
that were generated by the `init` command.

4. Update the following values in the `dbt_project.yml` file:
```yaml
name: jaffle_shop # this normally says my_new_package

...

profile: jaffle_shop # this normally says default

...

models:
  jaffle_shop: #this normally says my_new_package. It should match the value for `name:`
    ...
```

## Connect to BigQuery
When developing locally, dbt connects to your data warehouse using a `profile`.
Profiles are stored in a yaml file.
1. Create a file in the `~/.dbt/` directory named `profiles.yml`.
2. Move your BigQuery keyfile into this directory.
3. Copy the following into the file — make sure you update the values where
indicated
```yaml
jaffle_shop:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: bigquery
      method: service-account
      keyfile: /Users/claire/.dbt/dbt-user-creds.json # replace this with the full path to your keyfile
      project: grand-highway-265418 # Replace this with your project id
      dataset: dbt_alice # Replace this with dbt_your_name, e.g. dbt_bob
      threads: 1
      timeout_seconds: 300
      location: US
      priority: interactive
```

4. Execute the debug command from your project to confirm that you can successfully
connect
```shell-session
$ dbt debug
```
Confirm that the last line of the output is `Connection test: OK connection ok`.

<div class='text-left'>
    <a href="#" data-featherlight="/img/successful-dbt-debug.png">
        <img
            data-toggle="lightbox"
            width="300px"
            alt="A successful dbt debug command"
            src="/img/successful-dbt-debug.png"
            class="docImage" />
    </a>
</div>

### FAQs
* I'm not using BigQuery. [Where can I get a sample profile for my database?](faqs/sample-profiles)
* [Why is the `profiles.yml` file outside my project?](faqs/separate-profile)
* [What should I name my profile?](faqs/profile-name)
* [What should I name my targets?](faqs/target-names)
* [Can I use environment variables in my profile?](faqs/profile-env-vars)


## Perform your first dbt run
Our sample project has some example models in it. We're going to check that we
can run them to confirm everything is in order.
1. Execute the run command to build your first (example) models:
```shell-session
$ dbt run
```
You should have an ouput that looks like this:
<div class='text-left'>
    <a href="#" data-featherlight="/img/successful-dbt-run.png">
        <img
            data-toggle="lightbox"
            width="300px"
            alt="A successful dbt run command"
            src="/img/successful-dbt-run.png"
            class="docImage" />
    </a>
</div>


## Commit your changes
We need to commit our changes so that our repository has up-to-date code.

1. Link the GitHub repository you created to your dbt project by running the following
commands. Make sure you use the correct git URL for your repository.
```shell-session
$ git init
$ git commit -m "Create a dbt project"
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/dbt-tutorial.git
$ git push -u origin master
```


> ℹ️ If this is your first time using git, it's worth taking some time to
understand the basics.
