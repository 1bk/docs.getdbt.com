Now that we've set up our environment, and chosen the way we want to develop,
we can create a dbt project!

The process of creating a project is where the workflow differs the most between
dbt Cloud and dbt CLI workflows -- make sure you follow the right intrsuctions.

## dbt Cloud
### Create a project
dbt Cloud makes the process of creating a new project (with example models)
very easy! Once we have a new project, we can start writing our own models.

1. Create a dbt Cloud account [here](https://cloud.getdbt.com/signup/). If your
organization already has a dbt Cloud account, ask an admin to add you as a
Developer.
2. If you created a new account, a new project should automatically be created.
If you were added to an existing account:
    * Click the hamburger menu, then `Account Settings`, then `Projects`.
    * Name your project "dbt Tutorial", and click `Save`. There's no need to fill
  in the other details.
    * Click the hamburger menu, and then `Home`.
    * Switch the project in the header bar to your new "dbt Tutorial" project.
3. Complete the onboarding flow:
    * Connect to BQ
    * Add a repository -- choose managed repository (if you're comfortable with git,
  you can also choose to link to an existing, but bare, repository)
4. Click the hamburger menu, and then `Develop` to go to the dbt IDE (Integrated
Development Environment). Select `Initialize a project` to create your project

### Perform your first dbt run
Our sample project has some example models in it. We're going to check that we
can run them to confirm everything is in order.
1. In the terminal bar at the bottom of the screen, type in `dbt run` and hit enter

### Commit your changes
1. Click the `commit` button, with a message like "Create a dbt project"

## dbt CLI

### Create a repository

1. Go to https://github.com/ and sign up for an account if you don't already have one.
2. Click on the green **New** button or go to https://github.com/new.
3. Type a repository name without spaces. For example, `dbt-tutorial`.
4. Click **Create repository** (without `.gitignore` and without a license).

            data-toggle="lightbox"
            width="300px"
            alt="Create a GitHub repo"

The dbt CLI comes with a command to help you scaffold a dbt project. To create
your dbt project:
1. Run the `init` command:
```shell-session
$ dbt init jaffle-shop
```
2. `cd` into your project:
```shell-session
$ cd jaffle-shop
```
You can use `pwd` to confirm that you are in the right spot.

3. Open your project (i.e. the directory you just created) in a code editor like
Atom or VSCode. You should see a directory structure with `.sql` and `.yml` files
that were generated by the `init` command.

4. Update the following values in the `dbt_project.yml` file:
```yaml
name: jaffle_shop # this normally says my_new_package

...

profile: jaffle_shop # this normally says default

...

models:
  jaffle_shop: #this normally says my_new_package. It should match the value for `name:`
    ...
```

### Connect to BigQuery
When developing locally, dbt connects to your data warehouse using a `profile`.
Profiles are stored in a yaml file.
1. Create a file in the `~/.dbt/` directory named `profiles.yml`.
2. Move your BigQuery keyfile into this directory.
3. Copy the following into the file -- make sure you update the values where
indicated
```yaml
jaffle_shop:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: bigquery
      method: service-account
      keyfile: /Users/claire/.dbt/graceful-creek-cred.json # replace this with the full path to your keyfile
      project: graceful-creek-264520 # Replace this with your project id
      dataset: dbt_alice # Replace this with dbt_your_name, e.g. dbt_bob
      threads: 1
      timeout_seconds: 300
      location: US
      priority: interactive
```

4. Execute the debug command from your project to confirm that you can successfully
connect
```shell-session
$ dbt debug
```
Confirm that the last line of the output is `Connection test: OK connection ok`.

<div class='text-left'>
    <a href="#" data-featherlight="/img/successful-dbt-debug.png">
        <img
            data-toggle="lightbox"
            width="300px"
            alt="A successful dbt debug command"
            src="/img/successful-dbt-debug.png"
            class="docImage" />
    </a>
</div>


### Perform your first dbt run
Our sample project has some example models in it. We're going to check that we
can run them to confirm everything is in order.
1. Execute the run command to build your first (example) models:
```shell-session
$ dbt run
```
You should have an ouput that looks like this:
<div class='text-left'>
    <a href="#" data-featherlight="/img/successful-dbt-run.png">
        <img
            data-toggle="lightbox"
            width="300px"
            alt="A successful dbt run command"
            src="/img/successful-dbt-run.png"
            class="docImage" />
    </a>
</div>


### Commit your changes
We need to commit our changes so that our repository has up-to-date code.

1. Link the GitHub repository you created to your dbt project by running the following
commands. Make sure you use the correct git URL for your repository.
```shell-session
$ git init
$ git commit -m "Create a dbt project"
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/dbt-tutorial.git
$ git push -u origin master
```

> ℹ️ If this is your first time using git, it's worth taking some time to
understand the basics.
