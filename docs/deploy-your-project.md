title: Deploy your project
---
Now that you've built your project, you'll need to run it regularly on a
schedule. This is because your source data will be constantly updating as your
Jaffle Shop has more orders and more customers. If you're building any of your
models as tables, the data will go stale unless you run your project.

## Commit your changes
1. `git add -a`
2. `git commit -m "Build first models"`
3. `git push`

[Here, we're building on the master branch, you shouldn't do that! ]

## Connect dbt Cloud to your repo
[ Other deployment options ]


## Set up a schedule
