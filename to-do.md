List of to-dos that I need help with:
* Add SQL highlighting to styles
* Add bash highlighting to styles
* Add yaml highlighting to styles
* ~ `copy` button on code snippets
* ~ Ability to collapse a snippet
* ~ Up next button at bottom of page. Only on tutorials though.
* ~ setup snowplow on this website (Drew: I've actually never seen Snowplow be
set up / have no idea what's involved, so I'd love to understand this!)
* Remove the `docs` part from the URL, e.g. `http://localhost:3000/create-a-project`
instead of `http://localhost:3000/docs/create-a-project`
* "Lightbox" the images so they aren't so big / they expand when you click into
them
* Figure out how to embed videos
* ~ In the "Build your first models" page, it says "go back to Getting Started
and copy the SQL" -- is there a way we could have a "Copy SQL" widget that just
puts it straight on your clipboard without having the code show up on the site?
(I can explain this more)
