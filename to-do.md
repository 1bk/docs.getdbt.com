List of to-dos that I need help with:
* Add SQL highlighting to styles
* Add bash highlighting to styles
* Add yaml highlighting to styles
* ~ `copy` button on code snippets
* ~ Ability to collapse a snippet
* ~ Up next button at bottom of page. Only on tutorials though.
* ~ setup snowplow on this website (Drew: I've actually never seen Snowplow be
set up / have no idea what's involved, so I'd love to understand this!)
