# Styles
List of to-dos that I need help with, roughly prioritized
- [ ] Remove the "next" buttons that don't make sense. Or figure out how to get them to show the right doc
- [ ] Make hyperlink colors distinct to font colors
- [ ] Update the home page of the docs
- [ ] Update the footer
- [ ] Remove the `docs` part from the URL, e.g. `http://localhost:3000/create-a-project` instead of `http://localhost:3000/docs/create-a-project` (maybe a `getting-started` prefix?)

- [ ] ~ Add "Edit docs" button
- [ ] ~ Make sidebar headings a little more consistent
- [ ] ~ Ability to collapse a snippet
- [ ] ~ setup snowplow on this website (Drew: I've actually never seen Snowplow be set up / have no idea what's involved, so I'd love to understand this!)
- [ ] ~ Image captions
- [ ] ~ Warning react component, like we have in readme.io
- [ ] ~ center align images
- [ ] ~ In the "Build your first models" page, it says "go back to Getting Started
and copy the SQL" -- is there a way we could have a "Copy SQL" widget that just
puts it straight on your clipboard without having the code show up on the site?
- [ ] ~ Video toggles for cloud / cli

[ Done ]
- [x] Add SQL highlighting to styles
- [x] Add bash highlighting to styles

- [x] ~ Up next button at bottom of page. Only on tutorials though.

# Video editing
- [x] Cut the "Create a project (dbt Cloud)" video into separate components
- [ ] Download videos from Loom and upload to YouTube for closed captions

# Content
