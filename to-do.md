# Styles
List of to-dos that I need help with:
- [x] Add SQL highlighting to styles
- [x] Add bash highlighting to styles
- [x] Add yaml highlighting to styles
- [x] ~ `copy` button on code snippets
- [ ] ~ Ability to collapse a snippet
- [x] ~ Up next button at bottom of page. Only on tutorials though.
- [ ] ~ setup snowplow on this website (Drew: I've actually never seen Snowplow be set up / have no idea what's involved, so I'd love to understand this!)
- [ ] Remove the `docs` part from the URL, e.g. `http://localhost:3000/create-a-project` instead of `http://localhost:3000/docs/create-a-project`
- [x] "Lightbox" the images so they aren't so big / they expand when you click into them
- [x] Figure out how to embed videos
- [ ] ~ In the "Build your first models" page, it says "go back to Getting Started
and copy the SQL" -- is there a way we could have a "Copy SQL" widget that just
puts it straight on your clipboard without having the code show up on the site?
- [ ] Update the footer
- [ ] ~ Video toggles

# Video editing
- [ ] Cut the "Create a project (dbt Cloud)" video into separate components
- [ ] Download videos from Loom and upload to YouTube for closed captions

# Content
- [ ] Videos for each section
- [ ] Update copy
